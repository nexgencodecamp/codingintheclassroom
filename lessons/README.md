Use the lessons directory as your 'workspace' for the coding part of the day.

Typically you will simply create a file called main.js (we have already created one for you) and you will run this inside the Chrome browser when you want to test your code.

To do this, the javascript file (main.js) must be 'linked' to an HTML file. This is the purpose of the file - index.html in this directory. If you take a look inside it, you will see a line that says:

<script src="main.js"></script

So to run your code, you will open index.html in Chrome (just find the file and double click on it or right-click on it and select 'open with -> Chrome') and open the Chrome developer tools to see what is going on.
